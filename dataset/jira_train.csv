Hmm.  Breaking #if($query.foo) compatibility isn't ok if we can't find a reasonable way to keep that and the sub then i'll ditch the sub.   But i much prefer $query.foo.bar over $query.get('foo.bar') so i'm not going to give that up quickly.  The type conversion suffixes are more than just nice since the main point of the ValueParser is to parse values.  If you don't care about type conversion then you may as well just put the source map into the context.  Anyway i'm going to see if i can make both work somehow.  If i can't then expect me to resurrect the sub in a later version where complete backwards compatibility isn't necessary.,neutral

I'm still not in love with the sarcasm or excessive negativity.  I'll just point a few things out.  1/ I didn't veto anything and this has nothing to do with C++.  I think it is a bad idea for us to generate code in a way that causes semantics to silently change when a new optional field is added.  This in dangerous in the long term.  2/ I have no problem reverting this change.  3/ Restoring the old constructor and marking in deprecated is probably a good idea.,positive

Sumeet we did it purposely because if the proxy services are dynamically loaded then we need to build those services at the runtime and redeploy them which is a little bit risky on a production environment. Also there is no mechanism to check whether a particular proxy definition is updated in the registry or not because this configuration is used only at the startup.  We can add this functionality to load the proxy services only at the startup time from the registry (this doesn't mean they are dynamic) but I don't see any value there. If you could explain a bit about your exact requirement I might be able to provide an alternative to this.  Thanks Ruwan,positive

bq. Actually DIH started as a standalone webapp inside AOL. We changed it because we didn't want to duplicate the schema in two places and also because we wanted to have it available by default in Solr installations.  Another web app means you need to procure hardware plan capacity/failover create firewall holes etc  Even if it were a standalone app I would still run it on the same hardware that runs Solr though I might run it on the secondary servers that aren't normally seeing query load.  Why would you need to have the schema in two places?  My DIH config doesn't mention any field names because all Solr field names match the MySQL field names.  Even if they didn't I'm not sure why it would be any different than any other SolrJ client which doesn't need to have a copy of the schema.  bq. Talking to multiple collections was never a goal for DIH ??I'm not sure what value it will bring.   I've got a sharded index,neutral
"{quote} ...but even if we don't do that i suppose it's also conceivable that someone might have their own Similarity implementation that is expensive to instantiate (ie: maintains some big in memory data structures?) and might want to be able to declare one instance and then refer to it by name in many different fieldType declarations. {quote}  I don't think this is really a use case we need to support: the purpose of Similarity today is to do term weighting not to be a huge data-structure holder.  While I know Mike's original patch went this way with LUCENE-2392 (e.g. norms) I'm not sure i like it being in Similarity in the future either.  Otherwise concepts like lazy-loading norms and all this other stuff get pushed onto the sim which is an awkward place (imagine if you have many fields).   So I think we shouldn't really design for abuses of the API. If there are other use cases for ""named similarity"" that have to do with term weighting I'm interested. ",neutral

I'm not sure about the deactivate method.  I also noticed that you have added a patch but being new to jira I'm not sure if that means that you've made changes to my attachment or something else.  Are you still looking for me to correct the formatting and to remove the extraneous methods/classes?  Thanks James,positive

[~bikassaha] Thanks for the heads-up Bikas! This JIRA is not concerned with the Tez integration for Pig and is simply the abstraction in Pig to allow for alternate ExecutionEngines in Pig. But will certainly change this on the Tez integration side of stuff.  Thanks a lot [~cheolsoo] for continuing this! I think everything looks good from my end. I can certainly see why we may want to keep this on a different branch until everything is finalized. Certain things may still need more work. For example OutputStats is not completed abstracted out as it still has references to POStore which is a MR implementation construct. ScriptState/PPNL/JobStats may still need more abstraction (especially PPNL) and reworking to incorporate a new ExecutionEngine abstraction. I think what we have done here is the minimum foundation for an abstraction though and it would be appropriate to put into trunk but these are not my decisions to make.   With regard to public methods that were changed I don't think most of them are a big deal besides as Cheolsoo said the PigServer throwing PigException. I never thought IOException was a good exception to throw but I think reverting PigServer back to IOException as it is userfacing code is not a big deal. The rest of the method signature changes shouldn't be worrisome because most of them are internal to the project.   However the change from JobStats to MRJobStats while necessary (as each ExecutionEngine would have it's own type of JobStats it would present to the end user) could be problematic because it is userfacing code and would probably break people who were previously using JobStats. That I think is the most important thing to keep in mind. The task of making the PPNL and JobStats clearly tied to the ExecutionEngine should be thought through also.,positive

Sorry I missed Bill's comment.  bq. We've seen similar exceptions when loading data that contains text with the column delimiter in it which produces shorter than expected tuples.

bq. Though pig itself compiled fine and is ready to go the contrib projects (owlzebrapiggybank/hiverc) didnt compile I think because either it didn't download dependices of those projects or didn't include them in the build path.  Ashutosh yes. I did realize it and as you rightly guessed it is because the ivy-dependency list doesn't have some jars that are actually being used by contrib packages. This is not an issue related to eclipse-classpath. However there has to be a JIRA opened to solve this issue of downloading the missing jars by ivy.   Can you please file a JIRA for this? Thanks,positive

"Using nutch with solr has been a very demanding request so it will be very useful when this makes into trunk. I have spend some time reviewing the patch which I find quite elegant.   Some improvements to the patch would be  - make NutchDocument implement VersionedWritable instead of writable and delegate version checking to superclass - refactor getDetails() methods in HitDetailer to Searcher (it is not likely that a class would implement Searcher but not HitDetailer) - use Searcher delete HitDetailer and SearchBean  - Rename XXXBean classes so that they do not include ""bean"". (I think it is confusing to have bean objects that have non-trivial functionality) - refactor LuceneSearchBean.VERSION to RPCSearchBean - remove unrelated changes from the patch.(the changes in NGramProfile HTMLLanguageParserLanguageIdentifier... correct me if i'm wrong)  As far as i can see we do not need any metadata for Solr backend and only need StoreIndex and Vector options for lucene backend so i think we can simplify NutchDocument#metadata.

"Bertrand - nice work. This is a great idea and the patch looks good overall. Couple of points:  - Don't forget the Apache header on the new Errors class - Maybe do the grammar corrections on the counter error messages separately? Just so we keep the commits to a single issue each.  - I'm not sure we need to retain the delegating ""formatValueList"" method in TestDriver. Something to discuss...   As for using Guava to do the string join - I know MRUnit used to have it as a dependency but this was removed in MRUNIT-50. Probably not worth bringing it back for such a simple method. ",positive

"(If it's just reading ints I was thinking just write 4-byte ints. That's got to be the fastest of all.)  The author would be Ted really his call. If it's more of an example for the book it could be attached to the book. If it stays that's cool too just need to have a think about fixing/documenting the issues raised here.  You've raised a different an interesting point about performance though. You find that the slow-down is actually in addToVector where it converts a String to byte[]? The thing is the corresponding line in the ""fast"" version skips this step and adds null.  Indeed also passing null in the ""normal"" version makes it twice as fast for me. It's still twice as slow as the ""fast"" version though. But I do wonder whether the example deserves a bit more attention. I may not know what I'm doing.

"{quote} This wasn't a problem with my patch right?  That was an issue of the mahout script in trunk itself? {quote}  Yes it was a problem with the script in trunk. I believe this was due to the fact that the job files were on the classpath instead of all of the dependency jars. Adding the job files to the classpath does not add the dependency jars they contain to the classpath as well. So no you didn't add this but it should be fixed (and is in the patch)  {quote} What is the -core option for?  I've never used it how does it work? {quote}  when you're running bin/mahout in the context of a build the -core option is used to tell it to use the build classpath instead of the classpath used for a binary release. This just follows the pattern established (by Doug?) in the hadoop and nutch launch scripts.  {quote} Also added a help message for the 'run' argument. {quote}  near line 72 in bin/mahout: (this is different from the --help question I had)  {code}   echo ""  seq2sparse            generate sparse vectors from a sequence file""   echo ""  vectordump            dump vectors from a sequence file""   echo ""  run                   run mahout tasks using the MahoutDriver see: http://cwiki.apache.org/MAHOUT/mahoutdriver.html"" {code}  {quote} So you already added the ability to load via classpath right? If we merge that way of thinking with what I'm currently working on (having a configurable ""MAHOUT_CONF_DIR"" which is used for all these props files) we could just have the mahout shell script just add MAHOUT_CONF_DIR to the classpath (the way you already have it adding the hardwired core/src/main/resources directory) and then it would work that way. {quote}  Yep that should do it as long as MAHOUT_CONF_DIR appears before src/main/resources we should be good to go. It should be added outside of the section of the script that determines if -core has been specified on the command-line.  ",neutral

It could have been created as a patch and that is far as its gotten.   Assuming that we're talking we're just talking about creating a simple .snk to create strongly named assemblies when talking about signing assembly:  I didn't see a .snk file in the Lucene.Net_2_9_4g branch when setting up the build scripts. I haven't looked in trunk yet.    The Lucene.Net_4e branch should have a already have a snk. I could add the same snk file to trunk and the 2.9.4 branch when I go add the build scripts to the trunk this weekend so that all the branches are building strong assemblies.  Someone would still need to go back to the tag and create a 2.9.2 version using the snk whenever the next release does come out.    ,neutral

Following the recent facets work I think that as part of this issue we should do the following two things (in addition to what I described above):  * Make OrdinalPolicy an enum with two constants (ALL/NO_PARENTS). It's already hard to support just these two (see LUCENE-4610 and LUCENE-4600) and it's not at all clear how to support arbitrary OrdinalPoilcy-ies that users will provide. ** Rather if one really wishes to encode only say levels 3 and below he can extend FacetFields and provide his own CategoryListBuilder. ** For the search side he'll need to provide whatever will work for him (I cannot even describe here what API exactly because of the complexity)  * Nuke PathPolicy. One can extend FacetFields and provide his own DrillDownStream. I'll need to check about that one but it looks like we can get rid of it too.,neutral
"I just glanced through in general: this is similar to the hack patch i used exploring LUCENE-4089 though I just used a Map<StringString>.  The part i didnt like when exploring was more related to how term index/term dictionary are separated: {quote} divisor: generalize this into something simple like a Map<StringString> of codec ""parameters"" that you set on IWC/IR. split divisor from ""don't load terms index"". define these as constants where they belong. I got unhappy here in the ""splitting"" part because I wanted the divisor part in TermsIndexReaderBase but that doesnt extend FieldsProducer (where i wanted the ""don't load"" part) and wrap the terms dict instead its backwards and terms dict wraps the TermsIndexReaderBase... maybe we should fix that too? I think this confusing the way it is but I didnt look at how difficult this would be. {quote}  But I think maybe I was trying to tackle too much at once... still as an ""untyped"" parameter I thought it would be useful to fix the semantics all in one break rather than causing confusion down the road.

Patch adds maybeRefreshBlocking which blocks on refreshLock. It also:  * Renames reopenLock to refreshLock * Shares the refresh logic between maybeRefresh and maybeRefreshBlocking. * Switches to use ReentrantLock instead of Semaphore(1): ** It allows to protectively obtain the lock in doMaybeRefresh (see comment in the code) ** It is better in general because it's equivalent to Semaphore(1) yet protects against an accidental bug where someone changes Semaphore(1) to Semaphore(>1).

"lemme see if I can help with the test. I feel bad I didn't supply one with the prototype patch.  About the Solr integration: this looks good! We can use a similar approach for autosuggest too so this could configure the analyzer for LUCENE-3842.  I wonder if we should allow separate configuration of ""index"" and ""query"" analyzers?

"Thanks Dawid.  bq. Yes this is pretty much the top-n nodes reordering that I did albeit without any optimization of how many n to take (the hardcoded magic constants should probably be justified somehow? Or replaced by a default in FST somewhere?).  bq. Deciding how many nodes to reorder is I think hard ??I failed to provide any sensible fast heuristic for that and I simply do a simulated annealing to find a local optimum.  Yeah the algo is simplistic now... and it does force caller to pick the params (though minInCountDeref=3 and maxDerefNodes=Inf are probably pretty good)... we can and should make it more sophisticated over time.  We have at least one spare bit to still use in the arc flags :)  bq. One thing I was wondering is why you decided to integrate the packer with the fst ??wouldn't it be cleaner to separate packing from construction? Granted this requires a double pass over the fst nodes and more intermediate memory but it wouldn't add any more complexity to the builder which is already ehm a bit complex . You can compare this design in Morfologik:  Well... it's tricky.  First I decided to change node targets to ords so that pack could use an array to (relatively!) efficiently hold node data eg inCount newAddress etc.  That required making the first pass FST ""modal"" (deref'd or not).  If we didn't do this then the packer would have to use even less RAM efficient data structures (eg Map<IntX>) I think?  Second the format written by the packer is tightly coupled with the FST reading ie there are sizable differences when reading packed vs unpacked FST.  But I agree it'd be cleaner if we could move packing out (eg Util.pack) and more strongly decouple packing from FST format...  One thing I'd really like to somehow do is create different classes for FST writing vs reading and different classes for each format.  We now have write-ord write-non-ord read-packed read-unpacked (and even the two readers have 3 different modes depending on INPUT_TYPE).  ",positive
From the dev list didn't want to lose this background (or make Uwe type it again <G>)  The idea was to maybe replace RAMDirectory by a ?clone??of MMapDirectory that uses large DirectByteBuffers outside the JVM heap. The current RAMDirectory is very limited (buffersize hardcoded to 8 KB if you have a 50 Gigabyte Index in this RAMDirectory your GC simply drives crazy ??we investigated this several times for customers. RAMDirectory was in fact several times slower than a simple disk-based MMapDir). Also the locking on the RAMFile class is horrible as for large indexes you have to change buffer several times when seeking/reading/??which does heavily locking. In contrast MMapDir is completely lock-free!   Until there is no replacement we will not remove it but the current RAMDirectory is not useable for large indexes. That?s a limitation and the design of this class does not support anything else. It?s currently unfixable and instead of putting work into fixing it the time should be spent in working on a new ByteBuffer-based RAMDir with larger blocs/blocs that merge or IOContext helping to calculate the file size before writing it (e.g. when triggering a merge you know the approximate size of the file before so you can allocate a buffer that?s better than 8 Kilobytes). Also directByteBuffer helps to make GC happy as the RAMdir is outside JVM heap.....  RAMdir uses more time for switching buffers than reading the data. The problem is that MMapDir does not support *writing* and that why we plan to improve this. Have you tried MMapDir for read access in comparison to RAMDirectory for a larger index it outperforms several times (depending on OS and if file data is in FS cache already). The new directory will simply mimic the MMapIndexInput add MMapIndexOutput but not based on a mmapped buffer instead a in-memory (Direct)ByteBuffer (outside or inside JVM heap ??both will be supported). This simplifies code a lot.   The discussions about the limitations of crappy RAMDirectory were discussed on conferences sorry. We did *not*decide to remove it (without a patch/replacement). The whole ?message??on the issue was that RAMDirectory is a bad idea. The recommended approach at the moment to handle large in-ram directories would be to use a tmpfs on Linux/Solaris and use MMapDir on top (for larger indexes). The MMap would then directly map the RAM of the underlying tmpfs..... ,neutral

"{quote} I don't really know much about NamedSPILoader but I think what you're suggesting. How would we support Factories loading unrelated classes like they can through ResourceLoader now? Assume they're on the classpath and use Class.forName? {quote}  It needs more discussion (and input from Uwe would help!) but it works like Charset.forName(""ASCII"") etc. We use this already for codecs and postingsformats (Codec.forName Codec.listAllCodecs ...).  Have a look at lucene/core/src/resources/META-INF/services for the idea. Basically you ""register"" your classes in your jar file this way: additional jar files (e.g. look at lucene/test-framework/src/resources/META-INF) can load more classes.  So this could support some idea like TokenizerFactory.forName(""Whitespace"") or something simple like that. So someone would not need to use org.apache.solr.analysis.xxx namespace to be able to load their analyzer stuff easily they use whatever package they want and register in their META_INF. And added jar files (other analysis jars) are automatically available this way.  I think Uwe mentioned this idea before though I think he had Analyzers in mind (e.g. provide language code and get back analyzer or something). Anyway thats for another issue :)  Just something worth consideration if we want to make these modules really pluggable.

FWIW I didn't experience the problem with Karaf commands when using Fuse ESB (based on Karaf 2.2.5) but I did have problems with Aries Blueprint when I tried to instantiate some of our own beans as an OSGi service.

Red color isn't really important it was just a suggestion to be more homogeneous ... but that can be revisited in a different jira. I agree an option is a good idea for automatically acknowledging hosts.  Not sure what the default should be: the current behavior is obviously to not confirm so we could keep that one or go for a safer one I don't have any strong opinion on that.,positive

Quick fix to interchange the order of constructor arguments of ClientIdAndTopic.,neutral
Sorry for the late review. Have a few minor questions/comments.  60. What happens if have 2 instances of Consumers with the same clientid in the same jvm? Does one of them fail because it fails to register metrics? Ditto for Producers.  61. ConsumerTopicStats: What if a topic is named AllTopics? We use to handle this by adding a - in topic specific stats.  62. ZookeeperConsumerConnector: Do we need to validate groupid?  63. ClientId: Does the clientid length need to be different from topic length?  64. AbstractFetcherThread: When building a fetch request do we need to pass in brokerInfo as part of the client id? BrokerInfo contains the source broker info and the fetch requests are always made to the source broker.  ,negative
Thanks for getting started on this. I have a couple of requests -  1. Could you please upload a patch to this JIRA and grant it to Apache ?  2. This patch doesn't apply cleanly to trunk would you mind updating a patch that would ?   It will make it much easier for us to review it.   Also when you said the zk connect option hangs did you get a chance to take a look at the debug/trace logs to see where it hangs ? Do you mind uploading those log files here ?,neutral
Hi ShengTao you would think if you follow:  1. Check if the service is there add if it is not. 2. Then add a bindingTemplate.  Then you would not be overwriting a bindingTemplates. You are right though if you are saving a service it will overwrite the existing one and it will remove any bindingTemplates if they are there. The current behavior is how the UDDI v3 spec tells us to so it but we could add a config option to differentiate from the spec.  Please let me know if you are following the above strategy and *still* seeing issues.   --Kurt  ,neutral

Stefan  > the said method is not public since it returns *all* workspace names regardless of user rights. please note that > the a session must only see/know about workspaces it is actually allowed to access.   I'm working on a garbage collector for the data store. The GC doesn't care about user rights or putting it another way it must be able to access all workspaces. Ideally I'd like to use a SystemSession but you can't get one outside RepositoryImpl or o.a.j.c package (i.e. getSystemSession(String) is package private WorkspaceInfo is protected). I understand that these APIs shouldn't be public but they're useful from within the core. In my case for the GC. I'm very interested in using another way to walk every workspace but this other way should guarantee that the repository won't shutdown during a walk operation. I'll check the solution Thomas said he'll be proposing but in the mean time that is what I'm using. Still I don't see why this APIs aren't public. Regards,neutral

Thanks a ton for your review Todd. Here's an updated patch which addresses all of your comments except the following.  bq. In EditLogFileInputStream why do we need to pass isInProgress as a boolean? If it's in-progress that means we don't know the lastTxId so it would be INVALID_TXID right? So we can implement isInProgress() by just comparing lastTxId.  Because in the case of pre-transactional ELFIS we pass in INVALID_TXID even though the log is not yet in progress.

Todd I briefly looked at the patch. It looks like you are trying to get rid of the Journal Spool in BN. Correct me if I am wrong. I don't think you can. BN makes a checkpoint from its memory state which differs it from SNN and CN. While it does it the namespace should be locked (for modifications) so the edits go into journal spool which is reapplied to memory after the checkpoint is finished. Please see the design doc in HADOOP-4539.,neutral

It'd work but it's a halfway hack to the real fix we should do in 0.92.  My points is that I think it is a good idea in general to raise this timeout (while adding configs so you don't necessarily have to wait since smallish clusters could use the max param if they want to speed this up)... we have run into the situation where not all RS came in the 3 second window (which really is too small given heartbeat frequency) so I've already ramped up the config timeout for fb production.  But I'm fine implementing the halfway fix if my argument still doesn't win you over :),neutral

This patch removes tohtml.xsl and adds configuration_to_docbook_section.xsl.  The latter generates a docbook section from our hbase-default.xml using maven-xml-plugin that runs before the docbook plugin.  Our book then xincludes the generated file (the patch includes this modification too).  Patch includes a edit of our book which adds a preface an index an appendix that talks of configuarion another on compression etc. ,neutral

hudson was hung just now for 7 hours in TestHRegion.

VM behaves like BEA but not as RI. It seems that RI checks method name 2 times and 2 times runs through constant pool. I suppose that first time it runs through constant pool just after parsing and second time before verifying. The first check is obligatory and the second only if -Xverify is on. It looks like code is duplicated. Now our vm makes check after parsing and only if -Xverify is on.   I suppose to leave it as it is or make method name check independently of -Xverify flag.,neutral

> Do you think attached patch is generic?  Nothing is generic until it's used in more than one place.  The above isn't complete (it needs e.g. 'read()' and 'seek()' implementations) but it looks like a good start.  But the real question is to you: could you use the above?  Can you present the data and checksums as input streams that support read(byte[] int int) and seek(long)?  It also assumes a particular checksum implementation CRC32.  If we wish to allow for others that aspect could be generalized by adding a codec-like interface for checksummers.  But I think we should probably skip that this iteration. ,neutral

I think my first preference  would be to make this only a java 7 and up feature. The change is very clear and we can use our normal testing methods.  Meanwhile users can set their umask appropriately.  My second preference would be only  to only change permissions by default  with java 7 and higher. I think we really need to have tests for the default configuration and non-portable tests might have to be customized to different environments which seems like a lot of effort for something that won't be used moving forward.  I am sorry I didn't chime in earlier.  Time has been quite tight recently.   ,negative
I think clearing private fields should work in all JVMs since that's what the call to f.setAccessible(true) is for.

I found the reason why we observe different behaviors with the network server: Since you run with the default security manager you actually get derby.system.home set as a system property as a side effect (see line ca line 586 in NetworkServerControl.java) as part of the set-up of the security manager. I ran without the security manager so I did not get it set.   I do think though that the old behavior was buggy: I can't see why one should need to set derby.system.home explicitly to get the auto-boot behavior. Unless someone can explain why this should be so I'll file a bug for that. ,neutral

Noah said he?s going to fix this in his build-fauxton branch but I?d like to explain this for posterity.  make indeed throws this error I didn?t suggest it is a grunt.js error but it?s the way we use Autotools. In particular in how we use Autotools for packaging. Each file that is supposed to end up in our final apache-couchdb-x.y.z.tar.gz tarball needs to be marked as such in a Makefile.am. For Fauxton that means we maintain a list of Fauxton files in src/Makefila.am specified as `FAUXTON_FILES`:  FAUXTON_FILES = \     fauxton/app/addons/activetasks/assets/less/activetasks.less \     fauxton/app/addons/activetasks/base.js \     fauxton/app/addons/activetasks/resources.js \     ?and so on  In that list there is a line: `fauxton/app/initialize.js` e.g. where we say that file is supposed to go into the release tarball. That file however does not exist at the time `make dist` is run so make complains. I assume the solution is that make needs to call grunt at some point to turn fauxton/app/initialize.underscore into fauxton/app/initialize.js and I think that is what Noah is doing in his branch. I just wanted to explain why this isn?t a make error. ,neutral

That's what reminded me of ubjson actually. I looked at UBF and it looks rather complicated for a data exchange. I wouldn't say no but I don't have any interest in supporting it.  ubjson shouldn't be anything more than writing a parser (which should be ~trivial) and then adding the logic to switch (de)serializers based on content and accept types. I have no idea what UBF really even is under the hood but it sounded a lot more complicated.,neutral

Well since you didn't respond to my request I finally did without and checked out what you did.   First of all looking at CIncludeTransformer I have to say that I don't understand why it is doing its own caching. Caching should be the concern of pipelines and sources. If you want preemptive loading of cached content this would much better be implemented as a Source wrapper. In fact we now have such a class in the scratchpad area.  One unpleasant implication of the current design is that as an unsuspecting user of this class when you turn on caching in this transformer the cached contents of any included cocoon:// source that identifies a caching pipeline would be cached twice! Once by the pipeline itself and once by the CIncludeTransformer.  Now concerning your patch. I don't quite understand why you retain the validity of the cached contents. The algorithm the caching pipeline uses to determine the validity of the cached contents is as follows: first it looks at the validity of the cached pipeline contents itself then if the validity by itself indicates it needs a current validity to check against then the pipeline contructs a pipeline validity by calling the participating components' getValidity() methods. If your component now returns the same validity object that you previously returned then  that does not make much sense to me.  Since I really needed this functionality myself and I didn't have enough time to discuss and refactor the CIncludeTransformer I implemented my own very basic IncludeTransformer that does exactly what I need no more no less. I'll post it here if anyone want to use it.  I also looked at the XIncludeTransformer to see if I could implement caching in that one instead. But it seems that the XIncludeTransformer reads included content from URL objects instead of from Source objects.,neutral

The tricky thing with all the stacktraces we have as of now is that they don't seem to be the cause of the issue. Something is eating all the memory and as a consequence stuff starts to go wrong in arbitrary places. We need to find whatever is eating the memory in the first place. It might be very well be releated to the security provider. Can you try to run a memory profiler and see whether you can spot what is holding all the memory?,neutral

I've just gotten a chance to look at this.  A few things jump out immediately.  1) I have to chew over the changes to Cayenne core a bit more.  Off hand they don't seem bad but something feels weird about it.  2) While I can appreciate the cut working like a remove it's a bit weird to be prompted to delete the item.  3) I can't paste an ObjEntity I just cut back to the same DataMap.  With the lack of an undo feature the only reasonable thing for me to do is a revert the datamap.  4) I think my font changed for labels.  I'll have to verify that.  Looking at #3 again actually I can't seem to paste at all.  I even tried creating a new DataMap and was unable to paste the ObjEntity to that.,neutral
Sorry it took so long to drag this up.  I think the issue I had was with the Customer => BillingInfo and Customer => ShippingInfo relationships.  BillingInfo and ShippingInfo each inherit from Address.  IIRC a runtime relationship was being created for Customer => Address which was messing things up.  I'll have to dig through the SVN history to see what I did with mandatory relationships that I mentioned being problematic in the initial bug submission.,negative
I was actually trying to debug the issue and didn't see anything that looked like it would nuke the DataMap/DataNode under the DataDomain and was wondering if it was a visual issue but didn't try saving the model to see if it had actually deleted it.

"Not sure if the patch was pushed for review or not. In any case fixing the build is pretty trivial the changes made to ModificationStatement should just be reverted (and we should just pass the CL in argument to executeWithCondition() to SP.cas()).  Other than that: * I believe we now refuse CL.SERIAL for the cas() method (because CL.blockfor() throw an UnsupportedOperationException for SERIAL). Maybe we can make SERIAL mean ""wait for nothing on commit not even a local one"" (which probably amount to making CL.blockfor() return 0 for SERIAL and adding a 'if' in WriteResponseHandler ctor to signal right away if blockfor is 0). * I don't think CL.ANY will really work as for normal writes since we don't generate hints for commit. Maybe we could (generate hints) ultimately btw but in the meantime it might make more sense to refuse it (and thus make the default for CAS be either SERIAL if we do the preceding point or ONE). * We don't call CL.validateForWrite() when calling CAS (and we shouldn't as it complains with SERIAL) but maybe we should add a validateForConditionalWrite that would at least check we have the right replication strategy when using the multi-DC specific CLs.",neutral

"bq. CASSANDRA-2444 got in the way  I'm not sure what the right solution is here.  I buy the premise of 2444 that you don't necessarily want to get hammered by compaction when you're first starting up (warming up caches).  So I don't think ""check for compactions ever N seconds"" is a great policy.  But I'm not sure ""check every N seconds starting M minutes after startup"" is great either because it's not something a user will just guess when he's wondering ""why aren't compactions happening yet?""  Any other ideas?",neutral
"Split out some fixes to the SSTII bytes tracker getting out of sync w/ the underlying stream and did some cleanup to make the streamed/file versions less divergent.  Also adds parallel compaction testing to LazilyCompactedRowTest.  CliTest and DefsTest generate compaction loads (in DefsTest's case on the Migrations CF -- haven't dug into CliTest as much) that break w/ parallel enabled although the test doesn't actually fail (argh).  Haven't figured out what's causing that and haven't come up with a way to reproduce in a ""real"" test yet.  The DefsTest does mix lazy/nonlazy iteration in the merge which may be relevant.  bq. I'm also no proposing to complicate things.    You're right poor choice of words on my part.  Latest gives the merge executor a SynchronousQueue.  I think that's a better way to cut worst-case than the Deserializer for the reason given previously.  bq. 'if...instanceof' business is a bit error prone/ugly  Agreed. Added getColumnCount + reset to ICountableColumnIterator sub-interface.  bq. say how multithreaded_compaction is different from concurrent_compactors and that multithread_compaction is likely only useful for SSDs in cassandra.yaml  done  bq. The bytesRead ""race"" should also be fixed in CompactionIterable  done  bq. I would have put the code in CompactedRow.close() at the end of the LCR.write() instead of adding a new method as it avoids forgetting calling close   I did consider that but it feels weird to me to have write implicitly call close.  I guess we could just change the method name? :)  bq. We can make PreCompactedRow.removeDeletedAndOldShards a public method and use it in PCI.MergeTask  done",neutral

I don't care if everything is pretty or not but we should at least support basic admin functionality in IE IMO (though I have not used it for years for just about anything).,negative
I've looked at what can be done within the NSIS framework we use to build the Windows installer.,negative
A feature with wrong functionality is as bad as if not worse than a bad performance.,negative

Am I doing something stupid here?,negative
* Replaced TreeMap with an Array of final 'Segment' objects ** (now very slightly faster than trunk) * Rebased for trunk * Removed the patch renaming SSTableReaderTest to SegmentedFileTest  I didn't remove the builder pattern because the alternative seems pretty ugly (copying the segments array for every append).,negative

If you want to have a binary sequencefile format then do this.,neutral
What if you want to change this binary format?,neutral
You must take care about versioning then and that is because we need a proxy between the inputformat and our vertex API.,neutral

The search result entry requests does not return the correct DN because it use the internal representation (byte[]) instead of using the user provided value which contains escaped values.,neutral
Here we have two options : 1) work with the internal value but escape all the special chars 2) work with the stored UP value.,neutral
I think the bnest solution is (2) because the UP value is supposed to be valid - it has successfully been parsed when the first request arrived -.,neutral
This will impact two parts : - searchResultEntry - all the response that contains a LdapResult and which returns a MatchedDN.,neutral
I already have a fix for the first request but the question is : which version will integrate this modification ?,neutral
any suggestion ?,neutral
Then you might switch filter chains to ?,neutral

I've been trying to test a patched build with ibm 1.5. on iseries but have run into trouble: - OOM with suites.All.,neutral
I've been running with -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M before and that worked in the past...Not sure what's going on now.,negative
A second run (with 2048M) only got worse (sooner) OOM behavior and after that I had trouble getting rid of my processes - apparent hang with derbyall:lang/wisconsin.java.,neutral
On rerun I let it go for 20 mins but apart from the database getting booted (derby.log) nothing at all showed up in any of the output files (i.e.,neutral
During the 10.5.1.1 test cycle this test took about 5 mins (and passed).,neutral

I remember that rule for line breaking in Japanese was very different from that of English.,neutral

So to prevent a rude awakening for some users it might be cool to provide some means (config or whatever) that works similar as the current version.,neutral

Using technical tricks like automatically appending parameters to create unique JobInstance makes alarm bell ring - we should not be trying to do clever arbitrary things in classes that form the foundation of the framework.,neutral
If job instance has a lifecycle that ends with first successful execution we should refuse to start the same job instance ever after.,neutral
We described before that there are times that operators for whatever reason what's to restart a job with the same instance.,neutral

And even if it would be who makes sure that the context loader at the time the shell was created is the same as the context loader at the time the shell is used?,neutral
Can we even be sure that the thread is the same?,neutral
If a threaded management is needed then a new class should be used that ensures the conditions are fulfilled.... that is at last that the context loader is unchanged.,neutral
I know in your webapp this condition might be fulfilled but GroovyShell is not special to web applications.  ,neutral
Because of that the default parent is the same loader as the loader that loaded the class GroovyShell - this loader knows the groovy classes.,neutral
Setting the context class loader would require a test if the context loader knows Groovy classes and if this class is the same as the expected loader... what do we do if that is not the case?,neutral

In other words using the setGenerateImportedSchemas() setter or not obviously makes a difference and given the fact that your main XML schema imports/includes the other one I'd suggest that you change your code generation strategy.,neutral

Erick   First of all anyone upgrading should examine CHANGES.txt which would certainly have a note on this explicitly in the upgrading section of that document.,neutral
Secondly most point-release upgrades people do are ones in which the config stays the same.,neutral
Thirdly the scenario you present in which someone copies a subset of their 3.5 schema would only error if that person ALSO chose to omit the defaultSearchField declaration -- but why would they do that?,neutral
If that's true it'd be nice if we had a standard way to annotate such code so we can methodically remove the old stuff.,neutral
@deprecated isn't enough because it's just at the method/class level not an internal if branch.,neutral
This has been the history of Lucene and the thing about the project that I admired most - heavy hands where checked at the door.,neutral

Honestly there is no way around this issue - of course we must discuss and come to some solution regarding Lucene/Solr at this point.,negative

It's great to see you've gotten the ball rolling Chris.,positive

Ok cool this is just a matter of adding strings to the various [NotFound()|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/0.15.0-rc4/src/files/files.cpp#L160] returns in files.cpp  There are a number of error cases in the [browse|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/0.15.0-rc4/src/files/files.cpp#L204] and [read|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/0.15.0-rc4/src/files/files.cpp#L204] endpoints I'd imagine one could change the javascript to generate bad requests which should be sufficient to test this :),positive

Thanks Arpit!,neutral
I think your logic is right.,neutral
1,neutral
FileSystemView is the user file system view so it can have canDelete() and canRead() methods ..... this is fine.,neutral
FileSystemView can have user object to indicate whose file system view it is representing.,neutral
3,neutral
In that case caching will be at the FileSystemView level (not at FileObject level).,neutral
Logically this is also fine.,neutral
NativeFileSystemView represents the underlying OS file system view - no more no less.,neutral
Caching is a specialized function.,neutral
So if necessary we can add another FileSystemManager implementation which will support caching.,neutral
So the action items: 1. canDelete() canRead() and canWrite() will be moved to FileSystemView from FileObject.  ,neutral
Please review and close out if appropriate.,neutral
Thanks very much for the contribution.,neutral

In my experience this kind of shadowing always causes bugs in the future because it is so easy to lose track of which copy of the redundant field is being used.,neutral
"So the constructor for this class should call setUUID( permUUID ) rather than stuffing the shadowing field via ""this.permUUID = permUUID"".",neutral
o Once you do that you can get rid of the getUUID() setUUID() and getObjectID() methods in this class.,neutral
o I have reservations about the second constructor for this class (the one which is used to create a key descriptor rather than a full-fledged permissions descriptor).,neutral
However I see that you are following the data dictionary patterns for the other permissions descriptors.,neutral
But we should put a sticky note on our brains to remind ourselves to clean up this pattern in the future--partially initialized data is brittle.,neutral
Don't worry that's another project and not part of the sequence generator work.,neutral
SYSSEQUENCESRowFactory  o I think that you should flip the order of the keys in the second index.,neutral
That is the key order should be ( schemaID sequenceName ) rather than ( sequenceName schemaID ).,neutral
But maybe you have a use for an index with key order ( sequenceName schemaID ) which I'm not seeing.,neutral
SYSROLESRowFactory  o As with SYSSEQUENCESRowFactory I think that buildColumnList() should return a larger array one cell for each column in the table.,neutral
DataDictionary  o The header comment for getPermDescriptor() does not seem to describe the method.,neutral
Thanks -Rick ,neutral

Why use an ad-hoc script that's known (according Erik himself) to have false positive that require manual inspection (which is also not part of the version controlled source tree) when you we have a built-in (aspectj*.jars are already included as build/runtime dependencies) tool specifically for such tasks?,neutral
You can do this for info messages too for more performance when that is off.,neutral
Ah ok ... thanks for the heads up.,neutral
Changes to the test look good and your method for finding which are right/wrong is correct.,neutral
I would advise that a good thing to do once you have fixed this issue is to then perform a similar test modification for setting a valid value and using batching.,neutral
I've started to work towards support for visualising services and cascading configuration.,neutral
The changes in this patch aren't a complete solution but they're free-standing give basic service visualisation and shared configuration support.,neutral
I've introduced a decorator framework for relationships so we can draw the service triangles (or package names).,neutral
The service handling will need to be updated slightly once we're not working from the DummyInfoProvider.,neutral
Handling of services which aren't consumed and services which are consumed by multiple bundles is pretty weak.,neutral
I've also started to add cascading configuration.,neutral
ComponentAppearances will also inherit from one another when we have nested components (like a bundle inside an application).,neutral
I've only switched the ComponentColorElement (which was the ComponentColorProperty) over to use the new configuration so far but I'll switch the other elements over to using the new configuration next.,neutral
In the new version elements have two methods - render() which draws them and apply() which  initialises shared properties like colour.,neutral
This allows for a two-phase rendering.,neutral
:)  I've renamed ComponentColorProperty to be ComponentColorElement and RelationshipAggregation to TwistieAggregation.,positive
I've also moved RelationshipElement to the elements namespace.,neutral
Looks like this is fixed :),positive

The attached patch fixes two problems:   * the first one which happen when the class is loaded from the boot classloader (in which case we now use the system classloader to load the enclosing class)   * the second one which is the fact that all kind of linkage errors can happen when loading the class and this would really disturb the classloader correct behavior,neutral

David  I completely agree that providing more intelligence in the PO creation process would be very helpful especially for larger businesses.,neutral
I can just about cope with the amount of manual intervention required but in the not too distant future I can see the need for some of the rules you suggest.,neutral
The idea of consolidating POs (or SOs I guess) came mainly because I end up having multiple small POs for some of my suppliers.,neutral

In any case the code for the toBytes method is written now so it should be a simple thing to move it to the PType implementation classes.,neutral

One of the things I changed in jnr-posix was to make stat and fstat use stati64 and fstati64 respectively instead of stat64 and fstat - the last may be why its breaking with jna-posix.,neutral
Look in WindowsLibCFunctionMapper.java for the fstat mapping - it may all magically work if you change fstat to map to _fstat64 (note: no 'i' in the name - uses stat64 struct instead of stati64 ... they have different sized atime ctime mtime fields).,neutral
Otherwise the WindowsFileStat structure looks ok apart from the st_blocks and st_blksize fields at the end which are not part of the windows stat64 struct so will probably be filled with either zero or garbage.  ,neutral

If we redid the meta tables in this format we'd be using an access that is natural to hbase a scan as opposed to the perverse expensive getClosestRowBefore we currently have that has to walk backward in meta finding a containing region.,neutral
This issue is about changing the way we name regions.,neutral
Converting to the new method we'd have to run a migration on startup changing the content in meta.,neutral
Up to this the randomid component of a region name has been the timestamp of region creation.,neutral
"HBASE-2531 ""32-bit encoding of regionnames waaaaaaayyyyy too susceptible to hash clashes"" proposes changing the randomid so that it contains actual name of the directory in the filesystem that hosts the region.",neutral
If we had this in place I think it would help with the migration to this new way of doing the meta because as is the region name in fs is a hash of regionname... changing the format of the regionname would mean we generate a different hash... so we'd need hbase-2531 to be in place before we could do this change.,neutral
The two machines do not share the filesystem.,neutral
There is an embedded Tomcat running in the same JVM but according to the logs the database is not booted twice.,neutral

I tested this again on Ubuntu 10.04 This works with the new Tomcat instance and then when I tried the 2nd time it is not working.,neutral
But when i delete the file which was created at <tomcat-home>/bin/search-index/write.lock  it works fine  but I'm not sure whether this creates other implications?,neutral
Further I think the tags are not saved any ware because after redeploying I found the tags I added are missing.,neutral

I don't see a direct relation between this issue and the issue of simplifying the implementation of efficient map-side joins (MAPREDUCE-1183 more or less).,neutral
File formats are forever.,neutral
But I'm not convinced its wise to add such support to the exisiting Java-only container file formats.,neutral
I don't however see that it follows that we should provide implementations of file formats with a large number of different serialization systems as that invites multiplicative long-term support issues.,neutral
I'd prefer that we instead direct users towards a single preferred high-level serialization system and a single preferred container.,neutral
We now need to migrate from these to a more expressive language-independent serialization system and container file.,neutral
Google benefits tremendously by having a single standard serialization system and container file format.,neutral
The further we depart from this the harder we make it to build systems like Dremel that multiply the utility of stored data.,neutral
Changing serialization systems or file formats is a major imposition for many applications.,neutral
They cannot afford to do it frequently.,neutral

I mistakenly thought 10.9 was supposed to work on Java 1.4 (in fact the 10.9.1 release notes say it is supported although we removed support for it after 10.8) and the build worked in my environment because I had j14lib set and the test ran just fine on 1.4.,neutral
I'll post a patch that makes 10.9 compile the test against 1.5 instead of 1.4.,neutral
The patch that broke the build on 10.9 was also backported to 10.8.,neutral

The idea behind this is largely the same as with our existing package structure - there is nothing technical in preventing *everything* to be in the org.apache.jspwiki -namespace (with no subpackages) but both aesthetics and experience tell us that it just makes sense to add subpackages to make class management easier.,neutral
In the same vein isolating the API interfaces into a separate package makes it a lot easier to manage than having everything dispersed around - e.g.,neutral
if we want to create a jspwiki-api.jar we only need to jar up the contents of a particular subdirectory.,neutral
If the developer wants to know whether he is using any possibly unstable components all he needs to do is to glance at the set of import statements on the top - if he's using other classes than org.apache.jspwiki.api.,neutral
* he knows that the classes are potentially unstable.,neutral
In addition it makes the committer's life easier since there is an agreement by convention that the APIs inside *.api are not to be touched without common agreement whereas anything outside of this package can be treated with more liberties.,neutral

Here's another crack at this:  1) The default behavior for Derby is the current behavior with all of its security holes for java routines.,neutral
2) To get secure behavior for java routines the customer has to explicitly opt-in.,neutral
Instead to access methods in the JRE you have to include little wrapper methods in your jar files that you loaded into the database.,neutral
3c) The search order for customer-written routines is SQL standard: First we look in the jar file where the routine lives.,neutral
Then we look in the other jar files in the order specified by SQLJ.ALTER_JAVA_PATH.,neutral
Then we defer to the system class loader.,neutral
3d) At runtime when we invoke the routine we make sure that it actually lives in the declared jar file. ,neutral

Is the bug really in NGramTokenFilter?,neutral
This seems to be a larger problem that would affect all tokenfilters that break larger tokens into smaller ones and recalculate offsets right?,neutral
I think WordDelimiterFilter has special code that might avoid the problem (line 352) so it might be ok.  Is there any better way we could solve this: for example maybe instead of the tokenizer calling correctOffset() it gets called somewhere else?,neutral
This seems to be what is causing the problem. ,neutral

> then we don't save IO by limiting the buffer size to 1 KB  I'm confused by this.,negative
My assumption is that when you make a request to read 1k from a disk file that the OS reads substantially more than 1k from the disk and places it in the buffer cache.,neutral
(The cost of randomly reading 1k is nearly the same as randomly reading 100k--both are dominated by seek.),neutral
So if you make another request to read 1k shortly thereafter you'll get it from the buffer cache and the incremental cost will be that of making a system call.,neutral
An alternate strategy is to not trust the buffer cache and read-ahead but rather to make your buffers large enough so that transfer time dominates seeks.,neutral
This can require 1MB or larger buffers so isn't always practical.,neutral
Is that what you meant?,neutral
[~lhofhansl] thank you so much.,positive

It would be good if folks can use standard Java i/o idioms with Hadoop.,neutral

Shouldn't we try to make this idiom work well with HDFS? ,neutral
I guess the gen stamp is unnecessary but the DN isn't going to automatically mlock newly appended data so the NN needs to somehow realize that the cached length is shorter than the new length and ask the DN to recache at the new length.,neutral
Alternatively I guess the DN could automatically mlock appended data but there are quota implications there.,neutral
On startup I agree that we can skip cache reports until the cache is populated.,neutral

I'm fine w/ not naming it Consumer - I agree it does not really consume it.,neutral

The failure of GdiplusStartup happened to because this function was called from a native method with RSP not aligned to 16 bytes.,neutral
It is not well documented in MSDN but it looks like RSP has to be always aligned to 16 bytes.,neutral
Some functions don't require it but some do.,neutral
A patch was made to the interpreter to fix this in assembly code so if a native method has an odd number of arguments additional 8 bytes are skilled by RSP to align it to 16 bytes.,neutral
So I am likely going to work on this soon.,neutral
What is the exact problem?,neutral
If it would as simple as just recreating ReplicationZookeeper or using RecoverableZookeeper J-D would have probably just done it :) ,neutral
You forgot to mention the part where I said that I have absolutely no idea if MinSize is important for some other part of the code )  Also it looks like if we add a check in couch_db:doc_flush_binaries/2 to see if we're not streaming an attachment of unknown length and then pass that information to couch_stream:ensure_buffer/2 so that couch_stream can decide if it wants to allocate exactly the requested amount or some extra it'd solve the issue.,neutral

"I can see why the test case just checks that the error string includes the exception text ""foo"".",neutral
That is a bit too lax I think.,negative
"The problem is not that the exception text is lost completely it does come through just that it is wrapped in an AvroRuntimeException(""Unknown datum type: ""+datum) error.",neutral
"So instead of the expected ""java.lang.RuntimeException: foo"" text being sent you get ""org.apache.avro.AvroRuntimeException: Unknown datum type: java.lang.RuntimeException: foo"".",neutral
The cause is that the call to SpecificResponder.writeError in Responder.respond ultimately calls GenericData.resolveUnion which in turn calls GenericData.getSchemaName before the line where the UnresolvedUnionException gets thrown.,negative

There are a few considerations to be careful about: 1) The hostname in service could be a vip name.,neutral
One way to address it is to get the ip address from the hostname service and use that for matching but that needs a dns lookup.,neutral

As I explained the XSL files have nothing to do with FOP so its impossible  for FOP to tell you which file/line number in XSL stylesheet(s) the problem  lies at.,neutral

Santiago and I  have removed the readExternal() writeExternal() methods (from interface Externizable) and instead rely on readObject() writeObject().,neutral
We still implement the Serializable interface.,neutral
We marked the TransformerFactoryImpl field in the TemplatesImpl class as transient to make sure it does not get serialized.,neutral

Thus fetchInsertIterator could be made private.,neutral
"This will always work irrespectively of the combination of various underlying technologies and it will be a thread-safe solution :  public class GroupsResource {      private UriInfo uriInfo     private GroupResource gr1 = new GroupResource()      @Context     public void setUriInfo(UriInfo ui) {         uriInfo = ui         gr1.setUriInfo(uriInfo)      }      @Path(""group1"")     public GroupResource group1() {         return gr1     }      @Path(""group2"")     public GroupResource group2() {         GroupResource gr2 = new GroupResource()         gr2.setUriInfo(uriInfo)          return gr2     }  }  It will also work well in cases when users try to do proxy-based client invocations as client proxies do not support @Context parameters on resource methods.",neutral
In meantime I will see what I can do with respect to the context injection into subresources... Perhaps in some cases modifying the subresource classes with extra methods might not be an option. ,neutral
